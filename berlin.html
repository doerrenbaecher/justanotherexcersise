        <h1 id="brandenburg">The Brandenburg Gate</h1>
        <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/D/east-berlin-former-0.jpg" alt="the brandenburg gate">
        <p>
          Berlin's most famous historic landmark is undoubtedly the Brandenburg
          Gate (Brandenburger Tor). Once a symbol of a divided nation, it now
          stands as a symbol of unity and peace. This impressively large
          Neoclassical gate was commissioned by King Frederick Wilhelm II in
          1788, and its design was inspired by the Propylaea in Athens'
          Acropolis. The sandstone monument is 26 meters tall, standing in the
          Mitte district's Pariser Platz, just a block from the Reichstag
          building. During the Cold War, its physical and symbolic position as a
          blocked gate along the Berlin Wall made it a frequent site for
          demonstrations by West Berliners. It's also famous for being the
          backdrop of US President Ronald Reagan's 1987 entreaty to Soviet
          leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the wall. It was also the scene
          of a poignant gesture in 1999, when political leaders from a variety
          of countries—including Germany's Angela Merkel, Russia's Mikhail
          Gorbachev, and Poland's Lech Walesa—together walked through the gate
          to commemorate the tearing down of the Berlin Wall 10 years earlier.
          Visiting the Brandenburg Gate at night is a special treat, and
          undoubtedly one of the top free things to do in Berlin. Address:
          Pariser Platz, 10117, Berlin

        <h1 id="re">The Rebuilt Reichstag</h1>
        <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/D/reichstag-building.jpg" alt="the rebuilt reichstag">
        <p>
          The Reichstag (Reichstagsgebäude) was originally completed in 1894
          where the Neo-Renaissance palace served as the home of the German
          Empire's Imperial Diet until it burned in 1933. It was not used again
          until after the reunification of Germany, at which point it underwent
          a 10-year reconstruction and finally became the home of the German
          Parliament in 1999. A highlight of this magnificent reconstruction is
          the replacement dome, the Kuppel. Made of glass, it offers superb
          views of the surrounding city, especially at night from the Rooftop
          Restaurant. If you're visiting in the summer months, be sure to check
          into the schedule of light shows and film nights for a memorable
          Berlin experience. Note that entry to the Dome and Terrace is
          ticketed, and due to demand, it's recommended that tickets be
          requested in advance. While registration is available on the day, you
          should expect a two- or three-hour wait. Free English language audio
          guides are available. Address: Platz der Republik 1, 11011, Berlin

        <p>
          Sandwiched between the River Spree and the Kupfergraben in a
          400-meter-long canal, Spree Island—better known as Museum Island
          (Museumsinsel)—is one of the city's most important UNESCO World
          Heritage Sites. Here, you'll find many of Berlin's oldest and most
          important museums, including the Old Museum (Altes Museum), built in
          1830 to house the Crown Jewels and other royal treasures. The New
          Museum (Neues Museum), destroyed during WWII, was rebuilt and opened
          again in 2009. It serves as the home of extensive collections from the
          Egyptian Museum, the Papyrus Collection, and the Collection of
          Classical Antiquities. The Old National Gallery (Alte
          Nationalgalerie), opened in 1876, displays Neoclassical sculpture and
          paintings from 1815-1848, as well as Impressionist and early Modernist
          pieces. The Bode Museum houses a collection of Byzantine art, as well
          as a large sculpture collection spanning from medieval times to the
          late 1700s. The city's most popular museum, the Pergamon features a
          Museum of Islamic Art, the Ishtar Gate, and reconstructed historic
          buildings from the Middle East. The newest museum attraction, the
          Humboldt Forum opened here in 2019 and houses the Ethnological Museum
          of Berlin and the Museum of Asian Art. Address: Bodestraße 1-3, 10178

        <h1 id="berlinwall">The Berlin Wall</h1>
<img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/D/berlin-wall.jpg" alt="the berlin wall">
        <p>
          The Berlin Wall originated in 1961 when East Germany sealed off that
          half of the city to prevent citizens from fleeing to West Germany. By
          the time it was torn down in 1989, the four-meter-high wall extended
          155 kilometers, dissected 55 streets, and possessed 293 observation
          towers and 57 bunkers. Today, only small stretches of this
          graffiti-covered travesty remain, including a 1.4-kilometer stretch
          preserved as part of the Berlin Wall Memorial (Gedenkstätte Berliner
          Mauer). It stands as a chilling reminder of the animosity that once
          divided Europe. Highlights of a visit include the Marienfelde Refugee
          Center Museum, with its exhibits relating to the one-and-a-half
          million people who passed through Berlin as refugees; the Günter
          Litfin Memorial, a former watchtower now set up as a memorial, which
          pays tribute to the first civilian killed trying to cross from east to
          west; and the Monument in Memory of the Divided City and the Victims
          of Communist Tyranny. Be sure to also check out the Window of
          Remembrance and the Visitor Center with views over the remains of the
          wall. Guided tours are available in English. Address: Bernauer Straße
          111, 13355 Berlin
